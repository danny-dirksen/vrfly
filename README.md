# VR Spaceship Scene

![A gif of a spaceship flying through space](/doc/demo.gif)

Note: While this project is best enjoyed in VR, it can be run on the web using a keyboard and mouse.

## Description

This is a work-in-progress A-Frame test project currently involving a small, rusty, flyable spaceship in vr which you can fly around a simple demo scene.

WARNING: The constant movement of the ship can cause a great deal of nausia. To save your stomach, keep the inertial damping on.

I'd like to add more features if my stomach can handle it.
