This is a work-in-progress A-Frame test project currently involving a small, rusty, flyable spaceship in vr complete with interactive controls, asteroids, mean cubes, a large freight ship that you definitely shouldn't float into, a neat little space pod, and constant, looming threat of loosing your most recent meal (to minimize this danger, keep inertial damping on using one of the buttons on the dash, but I forget which one).

Future work on this project depends on my stomach.
